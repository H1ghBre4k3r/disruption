# Disruption Development Roadmap

**Last Updated**: October 15, 2024
**Current Version**: 0.1.0
**Status**: Foundation Complete - Building Production Readiness

---

## Overview

Disruption has achieved **98-99% Discord API type coverage** with 180+ structures spanning 4,252 lines of production-ready code. The foundation is solid. Now we focus on making it **reliable, useful, production-ready, and ergonomic**.

### Current State
‚úÖ **Complete**: Comprehensive Discord API type definitions
‚úÖ **Complete**: Gateway WebSocket connection
‚úÖ **Complete**: Basic REST client
‚úÖ **Complete**: Handler trait system
‚ö†Ô∏è **Partial**: Event coverage (2/72 events)
‚ùå **Missing**: Testing infrastructure
‚ùå **Missing**: Error type system
‚ùå **Missing**: Rate limiting
‚ùå **Missing**: Modern bot features (slash commands, interactions)

---

## Strategic Priorities

The roadmap is organized into **4 tiers** based on criticality and dependencies:

- **Tier 1**: Foundation & Production Readiness (Critical)
- **Tier 2**: Modern Discord Bot Requirements (High Priority)
- **Tier 3**: Developer Experience (Medium Priority)
- **Tier 4**: Scale & Advanced Features (Long-term)

---

## Tier 1: Foundation & Production Readiness üî¥

**Goal**: Make Disruption reliable and production-ready
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
**Status**: üöß In Progress

### 1.1 Testing Infrastructure ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS

**Why First**: Can't build on 4,252 lines of untested code with confidence

#### Scope
- Unit tests for all type serialization/deserialization (180+ structures)
- Gateway connection tests with WebSocket mocking
- REST client tests with HTTP mocking
- Integration tests for end-to-end message flows
- Property-based testing for complex nested structures
- Test fixtures using real Discord API payloads

#### Deliverables
- [ ] Test dependencies added (`tokio-test`, `mockito`, `proptest`)
- [ ] Test directory structure created
- [ ] JSON fixture library (20+ real Discord payloads)
- [ ] `disruption_types` serialization tests (100+ test cases)
- [ ] `disruption_gateway` tests (WebSocket mocks, heartbeat)
- [ ] `disruption` main crate tests (mocked REST, client flows)
- [ ] Integration tests at workspace level
- [ ] CI validation passing

#### Success Metrics
- **100+ test cases** covering critical paths
- **Zero serialization failures** on real Discord payloads
- **CI passing** on all platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- **Regression prevention** for future changes

#### Estimated Effort
10-15 hours

---

### 1.2 Custom Error Type System

**Why**: Generic `Box<dyn Error>` makes debugging impossible at scale

#### Current Issues
- Generic error types provide no context
- Panics in gateway code (fail-fast during development)
- No structured error information for users
- Difficult to handle errors programmatically

#### Solution
Create `disruption::Error` enum with proper context and conversion traits.

#### Design
```rust
pub enum Error {
    Gateway(GatewayError),
    Rest(RestError),
    Serialization(SerdeError),
    InvalidState(String),
}

pub enum GatewayError {
    ConnectionFailed(String),
    AuthenticationFailed,
    HeartbeatTimeout,
    InvalidPayload(String),
    WebSocketError(String),
}

pub enum RestError {
    HttpError { status: u16, message: String },
    RateLimited { retry_after: Duration },
    Unauthorized,
    NotFound,
    RequestFailed(String),
}
```

#### Deliverables
- [ ] Define `disruption::Error` type with all variants
- [ ] Implement `From` traits for common error conversions
- [ ] Replace all `Box<dyn Error>` with `Error`
- [ ] Remove panics, replace with proper error propagation
- [ ] Add context to errors (file/line, operation description)
- [ ] Update examples with proper error handling
- [ ] Add error handling documentation

#### Success Metrics
- Zero panics in production code paths
- All errors have actionable context
- Users can programmatically handle specific error cases
- Error messages guide users to solutions

#### Estimated Effort
1-2 days

---

### 1.3 Gateway Event Coverage Expansion

**Why**: 2/72 events implemented is a major functionality gap

#### Current State
- ‚úÖ `READY` - Bot initialization
- ‚úÖ `MESSAGE_CREATE` - New messages
- ‚ùå **70 other events** not implemented

#### Priority Events (Phase 1)
1. **Guild Events** (Critical for most bots)
   - [ ] `GUILD_CREATE` - Guild becomes available
   - [ ] `GUILD_UPDATE` - Guild properties change
   - [ ] `GUILD_DELETE` - Guild becomes unavailable
   - [ ] `GUILD_MEMBER_ADD` - New member joins
   - [ ] `GUILD_MEMBER_REMOVE` - Member leaves
   - [ ] `GUILD_MEMBER_UPDATE` - Member properties change
   - [ ] `GUILD_ROLE_CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE` - Role management

2. **Interaction Events** (Modern bots)
   - [ ] `INTERACTION_CREATE` - Slash commands, buttons, modals

3. **Message Events** (Complete message lifecycle)
   - [ ] `MESSAGE_UPDATE` - Message edited
   - [ ] `MESSAGE_DELETE` - Message deleted
   - [ ] `MESSAGE_DELETE_BULK` - Bulk message deletion
   - [ ] `MESSAGE_REACTION_ADD/REMOVE` - Reactions

4. **Channel Events** (Channel management)
   - [ ] `CHANNEL_CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE` - Channel lifecycle
   - [ ] `CHANNEL_PINS_UPDATE` - Pinned messages change

#### Implementation Strategy
1. Add event variants to `Handler` trait with default implementations (backward compatible)
2. Add event parsing in main event loop
3. Add type definitions for event payloads (most already exist!)
4. Test each event with fixtures
5. Document usage patterns

#### Deliverables
- [ ] Implement 15-20 high-priority events
- [ ] Update `Handler` trait with new methods
- [ ] Add event fixtures for testing
- [ ] Create event handling examples
- [ ] Document all event payloads

#### Success Metrics
- **20+ events implemented** covering 80% of use cases
- Backward compatibility maintained (default implementations)
- All events tested with real Discord payloads
- Clear documentation for each event

#### Estimated Effort
2-3 days (types mostly exist, just need wiring)

---

### 1.4 Gateway Resilience & Session Management

**Why**: Current implementation will fail in production (connection drops, restarts)

#### Current Issues
- No sequence number tracking for RESUME
- Reconnection just re-IDENTIFYs (loses events)
- No graceful shutdown
- Panics on critical gateway errors

#### Features to Implement
1. **Sequence Number Tracking**
   - Track `seq_num` from all received payloads
   - Store last sequence number for RESUME

2. **RESUME Implementation**
   - Implement RESUME payload on reconnect
   - Fall back to IDENTIFY if RESUME fails
   - Preserve session ID across reconnections

3. **Reconnection Logic**
   - Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, max 60s)
   - Distinguish between resumable and non-resumable disconnects
   - Handle Discord-initiated reconnection requests

4. **Graceful Shutdown**
   - Close WebSocket cleanly
   - Abort background tasks properly
   - Send disconnect notifications

5. **Error Recovery**
   - Replace panics with proper error handling
   - Retry on transient failures
   - Log all connection events for debugging

#### Deliverables
- [ ] Add `seq_num` tracking to Gateway struct
- [ ] Implement RESUME payload and logic
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff reconnection
- [ ] Add graceful shutdown handler
- [ ] Replace gateway panics with errors
- [ ] Add connection state monitoring
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging
- [ ] Test reconnection scenarios

#### Success Metrics
- Gateway survives network interruptions
- Zero lost events during RESUME
- Clean shutdown with no hanging threads
- Automatic recovery from transient failures

#### Estimated Effort
1-2 days

).await?;

// Handle interactions
impl Handler for MyHandler {
    async fn on_interaction(&mut self, interaction: Interaction) {
        match interaction {
            Interaction::Command(cmd) => {
                cmd.reply("Pong!").await?;
            }
            Interaction::Button(btn) => {
                btn.update("Button clicked!").await?;
            }
            _ => {}
        }
